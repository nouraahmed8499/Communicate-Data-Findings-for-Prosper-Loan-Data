## by Nourhan Ahmed


## Dataset

> Prosper is Americaâ€™s first peer-to-peer lending marketplace, with more than 2 million members and over $2,000,000,000 in funded loans. Here we use the data available to the public (last updated on March 11th, 2014) from Prosper, which contains all the listings and loans ever created with 81 variables on each loan/listing, to do some data analysis. This dataset is financial dataset and this is related to the loan, borrowers, lenders, interest rates and stuffs like that. Prosper or Prosper Marketplace Inc. is a San Francisco, California based company specializing in loans at low interest rates to the borrowers. In this dataset, we are using the data from the Posper to analyse it and trying to find the pattern in the Prosper data. 

## Summary of Findings

> The highest Borrower state is California, because its population is higher. I did not perform any transformation as we are just investigating the distribution. and in most loans investors are only one. we can see that Borrower Rate was highest for not employed, and lowest for who earn more than 100k, we can see here that the BorrowRate increased alot between 2005-2006 and then dropped between 2006-2007 and then increased over the years 2007-2011 and 2011 was at his heighest and then started to drop again over the years 2011-2014. we can see that Borrowe rate increased in some years as borrower was a non homeowenr, but it decreased in 2010 and it went up again untill 2011 and then started to go down again.
